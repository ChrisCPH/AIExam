Tallet findes på side 1 og 4, hvor det nu er markeret med rødt. Rettet 5. november 2020. Hvem er det, der køber enfamiliehuse? Af Jakob Holmgaard og Anne Kaag Andersen For mange er et huskøb en stor begivenhed, som kun sker få gange i løbet af deres liv, og som kræver mange overvejelser. Men hvem er det egentlig, der køber enfamiliehuse i Danmark? Og er der forskelle på huskøberne forskellige steder i Danmark? Denne analyse ser nærmere på køberne af enfamiliehuse og undersøger blandt andet huskøbernes indkomst, formue, alder, uddannelse og sammenhængen til hvor dyrt et hus, de køber. Analysens hovedkonklusioner: • I 2018 blev der solgt 47.400 enfamiliehuse til privatpersoner og 2.500 til virksomheder. Blandt de huse, der blev solgt til privatpersoner, blev 34 pct. købt af én person og 66 pct. af to personer. • Huskøb\n"

      "Analyse 2024:01 18. januar 2024 Hver anden boligkøber er førstegangskøber Af Jakob Holmgaard, Line Thrane og Fenja Søndergaard Møller Efter en årrække med gunstige renteforhold og et stigende antal boligkøbere vendte ud- viklingen i 2022. Antallet af boligkøbere er faldet med en tredjedel fra 2021 til 2022, og det samme er antallet af førstegangskøbere. I 2022 købte 88.300 personer en ejerbolig, hvoraf 41.600 var førstegangskøbere. Det er det laveste antal førstegangskøbere siden 2014. 2022 har været præget af rentestigninger, høj inflation og stigende boligpriser, hvilket var med til at påvirke potentielle boligkøberes mulighed for at komme ind på boligmarkedet. I denne analyse ser vi nærmere på dem, som køber en bolig for første gang. Analysens hovedkonklusioner: • Gennemsnitsalderen blandt førstegangskøbere er stort set uændret de seneste ti år. Gennemsnitsalderen for førstegangskøbere i 2022 var 35,4 år, mens den var 47,9 år for de øvrige boligkøbere. Næsten 40 pct. af førstegangsk\n"
